# dsRIP
A web-based platform for designing dsRNA optimized for pest control: dsRIP

dsRIP is available at https://dsrip.uni-goettingen.de/

The web-based platform for designing dsRNA optimized for RNAi-based pest control, dsRIP, contains four integrated tools: RNAi target gene finder, dsRNA efficacy optimizer, off-target minimizer, and primer designer. These tools were established based on systematic studies in Tribolium castaneum and further confirmed in other insect pest species. The platform offers an easy-to-use automatized designer that takes the user from the selection of a pest of interest to a dsRNA design optimized for pest control purposes. The code will be available upon peer-review of the associated manuscript.
