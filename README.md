# dsRIP
a web-based platform for designing dsRNA optimized for pest control: dsRIP

The web-based platform for designing dsRNA optimized for RNAi-based pest control, dsRIP, contains 3 main integrated tools: RNAi target gene finder, dsRNA efficacy optimizer, and off-target minimizer. These tools were established based on systematic studies in Tribolium castaneum and further confirmed in other insect pest species. The platform offers an easy to use automatized designer that takes the user from selection of a pest of interest to a dsRNA design optimized for pest control purposes.

Video tutorials are available at XXXX.
